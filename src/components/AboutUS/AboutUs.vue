                <p> A to-do list is just a list of things you have to-do. That means basically anything and everything
                    can be on your to-do list—but just because you've written your to-dos down doesn't mean your to-do
                    list
                    is actually useful. Effectively tracking when your work is due can help you prioritize and get great
                    work done. But too often, that list of work to-dos is disorganized and disconnected from the actual
                    work
                    you're doing—which leads to less clarity and more work about work.
                </p>
                <p>The good news is that writing a to-do list doesn't have to be an exercise in futility. Take
                    control of your to-dos with these 15 secrets for making a to-do list that actually works.
